-SO WHY WE NEED MONGOdB?-------------------------------------------------------
->It is a Database where you can store data which can username,emails,password etc.
Because we need someone to manage our data and mongodb do this for us.IT provides 
us functionalities like CRUD operation and scalability and more.

-Connection---------------------------------------------------------------------
we can connect mongodb to our node application directly but is old fashioned and so haptic and time consuming.
That's why we use (MOngoose) a library which help us to connect
our database easily with node application

1st step- npm install MOngoose
2nd step- const mongoose = requires("mongoose") Creating instance of mongoose

-schemas and MOdels--------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we cannot directly add data to the database we need to specify some format
and we do that by making schemas, its like blueprints it defines which type of data
this database will accept.
And then We create Model of that schemas which help us to do operation
with our data like insert,delete,edit and more.

1st step- create schema using mongoose.schema it is a constructor function
provided by Mongoose.

const userSchema = new mongoose.schema({
    name:{
        type: String,
        required: true
    }
    age:{
        type:Number
    }
})

2nd Step- Now we have to create Model for this schema using mongoose.model-function
which is also provided by mongoose

const User = mongoose.model('user',userSchema)
in this function first argument of name of collection in which our data will be stored
and second one is the name of schema for which we are creating this model

3rd Step- Now we can use this model to create delete and edit the data
we can save() and create
